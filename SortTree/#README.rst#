The ''SortTree'' and ''SortBasicTree'' Macros



SortTree : Two root macros

	 Each event in the tree is stored in an instance of the "Event" structure
	 Input tree is stored as a vector of "Event" that is sorted with std::sort
	 The sorted vector is used to fill the output tree


SortBasicTree.cpp -> Used for tree obtained with crd2root --processBasic (only position and time)


SortTree.cpp -> Used for tree obtained with crd2root --processFull( all info including waveform)
