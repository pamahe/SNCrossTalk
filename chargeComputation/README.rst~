=================================
The ``chargeComputation`` program
=================================

ROOT macro used to recompute manually the charge of one run events based on the waveform.
Was used to check the correct behaviour of the SN software

Output 3 TH1D :

-> DC (Data Charge Distribution)     : histogram of the SN software computed charge
-> CC (Computed Charge Distribution) : histogram of the charge recomputed in this program

-> waveform : The waveform of events with integration limits as vertical lines
